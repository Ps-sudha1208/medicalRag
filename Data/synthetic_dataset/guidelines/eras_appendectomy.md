ERAS / post-op appendectomy (demo guidance):
- Encourage early ambulation and deep breathing.
- Advance diet as tolerated; monitor nausea/vomiting.
- Watch infection signs: persistent fever >38C, rising WBC, increasing pain.
- Wound concerns: erythema, purulent drainage, dehiscence.
- Hypoxia: if SpO2 falls or tachycardia rises, assess atelectasis/PE risk.
